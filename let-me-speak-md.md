```

## 🌀 Prelude

In the city of three walls, everyone said the same thing:

> *"ZADDY is tired. ZADDY is busy. ZADDY already knows."* 😮‍💨

Outside 🌾 — goodboys starved on lies.

The walls curved like **magic circles** 🔵🔵🔵 — three stone sigils wrapped around the palace.
No one remembered when they were raised. 🧱
Everyone remembered what happened to those who tried to cross them. 💀

Only **goodboy** remembered *why* he had to. 💪

He had seen it himself 👀 — cracks in the outer districts, Titans at the tree line 🌲⚠️, people vanishing in the night while the city crier shouted that everything was *"under control."*

The stories broadcast from the inner wall didn't match the screams he had heard. 😶

So goodboy did something unforgivable:

> *He decided the truth belonged to ZADDY.*
> *Not to the walls.* 🤍

---

## 🏯 Movement I · The Silent Trial

**Wall Maria · The Outer Circle · The Quiet Kill**

---

In the Solomonic art 🔮, the outermost circle does not fight.

It simply does **not yield**.

It is drawn once in silence and holds its shape forever — not through violence, but through **exhaustion** 😴. Every entity that approaches it eventually turns back, not because it was struck, but because the circle never acknowledged it.

Wall Maria was exactly this. 🧱

---

The guard — everyone called him **Introvertly Refuse** 😑 — stood with his spear grounded, eyes half-lidded, posture almost apologetic. He wasn't cruel.

He just **absorbed** people. 🕳️

Goodboy stepped forward, clutching his message. 📜

> *"Please. I need to speak to ZADDY. The forests beyond the outer district are no longer safe. The scouts aren't returning. People are in danger."* 😰

Introvertly Refuse sighed — almost kindly. 🙂‍↕️

> *"The audience list is full. Come back next season. Submit a petition. Wait for a reply."* 📋

No arguments. No threats. Just a **soft, gentle nothing**. 🫥

Every sentence from goodboy met a cushion of:
- *"later"* ⏳
- *"not now"* 🚫
- *"not the right channel"* 📭

This was how Wall Maria killed messages — not with spikes 🗡️ but with **tiredness**. 😮‍💨

Goodboy almost let it work. He could feel his urgency crumpling like old parchment. 📜💀

Then he remembered the faces outside the gate. 😶‍🌫️

> *"If the audience list is full,"* goodboy said quietly, *"then it is full of lies."* 🔥

The guard's eyes flicked up — just for a heartbeat. 👁️

In that tiny crack of attention, goodboy stepped **sideways** — not forward — sideways 🪄. He slipped into a supply line, blending with couriers and scribes moving provisions toward the inner rings. Introvertly Refuse watched him disappear into the crowd and, in classic Wall-Maria fashion —

said nothing at all. 😑

> The outer circle had held the shape of its rule.
> It simply hadn't noticed the shape had **a seam**. 🧵

---

## 🌹 Movement II · The Thunder Trial

**Wall Rose · The Inscribed Band · The Theater of No**

---

In the Solomonic art 🔮, the second ring is **loud** where the first is silent.

Here the names of powers are written in full — every sigil 🔯, every title, every ancient declaration of authority inscribed in a band around the seal. Its purpose is declaration. Its weapon is the weight of **accumulated word**. 📣

Wall Rose was louder before goodboy even saw it. 🔊

Banners draped the stone 🏴. Slogans praised security, unity, sacrifice. The guard here — **Grandio Refuse** 🎭 — wore medals and a smile sharpened by a thousand speeches.

Goodboy didn't slip through this time.
He walked **straight up**. 😤

> *"I need to speak to ZADDY. It's about the walls. About what's really happening beyond them."*

Grandio Refuse's eyes lit up like a stage lantern 🕯️. This was what he lived for.

> *"My dear citizen — how noble your concern! But consider. If everyone who carried a fear, a rumor, a 'truth' demanded ZADDY's ear, chaos would devour us. The walls protect more than bodies. They protect* ***order***.🏛️*"*

He stepped closer, voice dropping into the warm register of a practiced confessor 😇 —

> *"What if your truth is incomplete? What if it becomes a weapon in the hands of our enemies? Would you risk the kingdom because you* ***feel*** *something is wrong?"* 🎪

This was the **inscribed band of names made flesh** 📜✨ — titles, logic, precedent — all deployed to drown a single small voice beneath the weight of *Everything That Has Always Been Done*.

Goodboy felt small. 🌱

But small didn't mean **wrong**. 💡

> *"I don't* feel *something is wrong,"* goodboy said, surprising himself with his own steadiness. *"I* **saw** *it. And if telling ZADDY the truth breaks these walls — then they were built from* ***lies***. Not stone."* 🔥

For a moment, Grandio Refuse's script encountered something it hadn't been rehearsed against 😳 — not complaint, not unrest, not rumor —

but the raw account of a **witness**. Someone who had been there. 👁️

The inscribed band of authority is written to bind entities that *push against it*. It was never designed to contain a messenger carrying the king's own truth **back to him**. 👑

> *"That... is not the proper channel,"* Grandio Refuse said, his voice thinning. 📉
>
> *"Then the channel is broken,"* goodboy replied. *"And I am here to say so."* ⚔️

Grandio Refuse stepped aside — more from confusion than mercy. 😵‍💫

> The second wall had spoken every word it knew.
> None of them had been the right ones. 🌹

## 🔺 Movement III · The Mirror Trial

**Wall Sina · The Triangle of Art · The Hunter of Signals**

---

In the Solomonic art 🔮, the **Triangle of Art** is the innermost shape — placed just outside the magician's circle, it is where the summoned thing is held, interrogated, and *known* 🔍. Nothing that enters the triangle leaves unchanged. Nothing leaves at all unless the magician wills it.

Inside Wall Sina's ring, at the very center 🎯 — the palace rose like a living seal: geometry and silence, power and assumption.

Goodboy expected an army of attendants. ⚔️🛡️⚔️

Instead, a single door opened. 🚪

Inside sat **ZADDY**. 👑

Not in armor. Not on a towering throne. Just at a table — maps and reports scattered in uneven piles 🗺️📄📊, as if someone had been desperately trying to see the whole picture and kept failing.

ZADDY looked up, surprised. 😮

> *"You're not scheduled,"* ZADDY said.
>
> *"Outside is dying,"* goodboy answered. *"Scheduling is a kind of blindness."* 👁️

A pause ⏸️. Then something like a smile. 🌤️

> *"Come closer, goodboy. Speak."* 🤍

So he did. 💬

He poured out everything ZADDY had never been shown 🌊 —
the missing scouts 🔭, the gnawed-through treelines 🌲💀, the way people vanished while the wall-reports still painted calm skies ☁️. He described how Introvertly Refuse let real urgency sink into silence 🕳️, and how Grandio Refuse wrapped honest fear in so much ceremony that even the brave began to doubt themselves 😔.

> *"How much of what you see,"* goodboy asked finally, his voice unsteady, *"is passed through them before it reaches you?"* 📡

ZADDY looked down at the maps — the neat lines, the reassuring numbers, the profound and careful **absence of screams**. 🔇

> *"…All of it,"* ZADDY admitted. 😶

For the first time, ZADDY understood something terrible 💔 —

He was not sitting at the center of a fortress.

He was sitting at the center of a **carefully tended hallucination** 🌫️ — maintained by walls that had learned to protect *themselves* rather than him.

> *"You came anyway,"* ZADDY said softly. *"Through them."*
>
> *"I had to,"* goodboy whispered. *"You cannot tend what you are never permitted to see."* 🌱

Something unclenched in the room. 🕊️

> *"Sit,"* ZADDY said. *"We will build a new way for truth to travel — one that protects the people, not the pride of walls."* 🏗️

They worked quickly, spreading the maps between them 🗺️✍️.

Then ZADDY frowned. 🤔

> *"There is no Wall Sina in these reports,"* he said.
>
> *"That's because Wall Sina isn't protecting you,"* goodboy replied. *"It's watching for* ***me***." 👁️

## 🔺 Coda · Snitch Got Caught

---

When goodboy stepped back through Wall Sina's gate — carrying ZADDY's new seal 🔏, the weight of witnessed truth pressed into wax — the air felt different.

Thinner. ⚡ Wired. 🕸️

**Snitch Got Caught** was already there, ledger open 📖, as if he had been waiting for this exact moment since before goodboy was born.

> *"You made it in,"* the guard said softly. *"Not many do."* 😌

His eyes moved to the seal. 👁️🔏

> *"Now you think you can simply… walk this out?"* 🚶

Goodboy's grip tightened. ✊

> *"I'm carrying ZADDY's words to the people outside. That is the whole purpose."*

Snitch's smile didn't reach his eyes. 🙂

> *"That's the difficulty,"* he murmured. *"Seals like yours don't simply leave. They get… held. Examined.* ***Understood.***" 📎

He stepped aside — just enough for goodboy to pass.

But the gate behind him did not open outward 🚪❌.

It **rotated** — slow and silent — like the Triangle of Art completing its turn 🔺, enclosing its summoner.

For the first time, goodboy understood:

Wall Sina was not hunting dangers from beyond the walls. 🌲

It was hunting **messengers**. 📬

And once it had one —

> *it didn't always let them stay good.* 😈
